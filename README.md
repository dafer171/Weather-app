# Overview

## Software Description

This is a Java-based Weather Forecast application that retrieves real-time weather data from an API and displays it for different cities. The user can search for a location, and the app will show temperature, humidity, and weather conditions in a simple graphical interface using Swing.

## Purpose

The purpose of creating this software is to improve my Java skills, particularly in working with APIs and building a graphical user interface. Since Java is widely used in my workplace, learning it will help me grow as a software engineer and prepare for future development opportunities.
